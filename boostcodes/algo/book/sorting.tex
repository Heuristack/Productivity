\chapter{Sorting}

Generally, sorting algorithms are illustrated and implemented by using \emph{array} as the underlying \emph{data structure} in which elements' \emph{orders} are consistent with their \emph{indices} for a sorted set.
Specially, for an increasingly sorted set \code{S} represented by array \code{A}, the \code{order(i)} element of \code{S} is \code{A[i-1]} by default, thus the \code{order(1)} element of \code{S} is \code{A[0]}.
