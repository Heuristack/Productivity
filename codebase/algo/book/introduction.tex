\chapter{Introduction}

This algorithm notes are constructed focusing on the implementation of algorithms for illustrating purpose.
For any given algorithm, multiple possible implementations exist due to considerations, constraints or features
such as programming paradigms, languages, designs, run-time systems, architectures, choosing of data structures and requirements contexts, etc.

For a programmer, only understanding the basic principles of classic data structures and algorithms is actually not sufficient,
because this \emph{understanding} may not lead to \emph{fluent programming}.
In some cases, programmers have to exhibit their skills of programming as fluent as possible, e.g. when undertaking an interview for some position in a software company.

To achieve the \emph{fluency},
one may have to \emph{memorize} some code snippets of fundamental data structures and computation procedures for further usage.
These snippets are better written in a specific programming language such as C/C++ and should be as elegant as possible for easy remembering.
